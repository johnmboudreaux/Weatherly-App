#### Hi there. This is my submission of the Social Tables Apprentice Challenge. Below you will find some instructions for starting the app and some of my thoughts regarding this experience. I did want to take a moment to say thanks, for the opportunity to take part in this challenge. I really enjoyed it from start to finish and along the way I was able to learn some things, so overall I would rate the experieince 5 stars:).  


* Instructions for running the code
## To Start
#### from the terminal
	- run `npm install`
	- run `npm run server` in one console to start the server on port 3001
	- run `npm start` in another console to start the react app on port 3000

* A few thougts

1. What aspect of your submission are you most proud of, and why?
	I am very proud that I was able to figure out how graphQL works. It has crossed my path before, but didn't understand what it was nor how it worked. I was in school at the time, where it didnt apply, so I didn't have the time to get to know it. This challenge gave me the drive and opporunity to actaully dive into it and come out on the other end with knowledge that I didnt have before. It is a really cool technology and I'm pumped about been able to learn some of it!


1. What would you work on if you had more time? What features might you add to this type of product?
	A booking feature would be a nice addition as well as a way to ask questions about the venues. A calendar that shows blocked out dates for each venue would be helpful too, just to have that visibility if I was considering a venue for booking.


1. Of all the resources (blog posts, tutorials, videos, mentors etc.) you referenced, what was most helpful for you?
	The Apollo docs are pretty solid. They bailed me out a couple of times. I also really like medium blogs. They are generally pretty solid and contain good readable content that is helpful. 
	
	Something else that was helpful was the graphQL slack channel that I founf in your resources from the repo. I was able to get some clarity on an issue I was having trouble with. A random stranger from the abyss was nice enought to take some time and help me out. However, as usual, stack overflow and mdn docs are always a solid go to.
